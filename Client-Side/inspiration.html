        Unite was inspired by a desire to help Earthlings live in harmony. Humans have always pondered ways to flourish and improve,
        while reducing suffering and avoiding disaster. Innovation, conflict, or migration have been timeless solutions to your limits.
        Yet, modern global-scale threats such as nuclear annihilation and ecological collapse have made conflict and migration increasingly untenable.
        Here you are. The time is now. <br> <br>

        Some of humanity’s brightest minds have contemplated a planetary migration and began searching for Plan-et B some decades ago.
        Whether searching for planets like yours or researching what it would take to seed a barren planet in your own star system,
        humans have developed a deep scientific understanding of the very special parameters, and their relationships, that make life,
        and humanity’s flourishing, possible on Earth: solar energy, water, geothermal heat, and the presence of special elements, to name a few.
        This has been termed the Goldilocks effect – Earth seems to be just right. <br> <br>

        Yet most of you cannot affect planetary political or economic processes. You live in houses and apartments, villages and cities,
        in watersheds on the water planet, within political administrative units like counties, states, and nations.
        And while you are diverse genetically, culturally, and spiritually – you are all human.
        You share your planet with other Earth creatures that help sustain you. <br> <br>

        Humanity has produced and shared an incredible legacy of data, knowledge, and opinion about what it means to be human and to flourish as such.
        There are reams of perspectives on the optimal parameters, to produce happiness, comfort, wealth, harmony, sustainability, freedom, peace,
        security, equality, success, and other human ideals. These parameters describe relationships between self, others,
        and nature at and across many spatial and temporal scales. <br> <br>

        GIS technology, Big Data, the Internet, social media, and global travel have given you all, at once, an ability to search your own planet for
        people just like you and places just like yours. So while the telescopes and satellites keep searching out there, you have the ability to
        search around here, and within yourselves, to learn from people just like you. <br> <br>

        Unite gives any Earthling with Internet access the ability to adjust Goldilocks parameters at any scale to find a village, city, county,
        state, or watershed just like theirs. With a lead, you might just find a story, a civilization, a community that has a solution to a problem
        you have now. How did they do it? <br> <br>

        If you ever find a planet like yours or a way to make Mars green, you know that most of you would not board a spaceship without some human
        assurances that you would survive. And so it as at home, no human seems to be able to board a solution without first knowing that it is possible. <br> <br>

        And then such an inquisitive, practical, and cautious species will likely have a few more questions along the way. How much does it cost?
        How long will it take? Are we there yet? <br> <br>

        Unite creates the tools for your planet’s inhabitants to share the data and stories that describe the path to a better way of life,
        across all parameters and at all scales – while there is still time. <br> <br>

        Forget the pie in the sky - what are your favorite recipes here on Earth? <br> <br>
